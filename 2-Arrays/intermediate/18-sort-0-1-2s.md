# 75. Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Problem)

## Problem Understanding

We need to sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s in-place (without extra space) so that all 0s come first, followed by 1s, and then 2s.

## Approaches

### 1. Counting Sort Approach

**Intuition**: Count the occurrences of each color and then overwrite the array.

**Steps**:

1. Count how many 0s, 1s, and 2s are in the array
2. Overwrite the array with 0s first, then 1s, then 2s based on the counts

```javascript
function sortColorsCounting(nums) {
  let count0 = 0,
    count1 = 0,
    count2 = 0;

  // Count the number of each color
  for (const num of nums) {
    if (num === 0) count0++;
    else if (num === 1) count1++;
    else count2++;
  }

  // Overwrite the array
  let i = 0;
  while (count0 > 0) {
    nums[i++] = 0;
    count0--;
  }
  while (count1 > 0) {
    nums[i++] = 1;
    count1--;
  }
  while (count2 > 0) {
    nums[i++] = 2;
    count2--;
  }
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Two passes through the array
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Only using a few extra variables

### 2. Two-Pointer Approach (Optimal)

**Intuition**: Maintain three pointers to partition the array into three sections.

**Steps**:

1. `low` pointer tracks the end of 0s section
2. `high` pointer tracks the start of 2s section
3. `current` pointer moves through the array to process each element

```javascript
function sortColorsTwoPointer(nums) {
  let low = 0; // Tracks the end of 0s section
  let high = nums.length - 1; // Tracks the start of 2s section
  let current = 0; // Current element being processed

  while (current <= high) {
    if (nums[current] === 0) {
      // Swap with low pointer and move both
      [nums[current], nums[low]] = [nums[low], nums[current]];
      low++;
      current++;
    } else if (nums[current] === 2) {
      // Swap with high pointer (don't move current yet)
      [nums[current], nums[high]] = [nums[high], nums[current]];
      high--;
    } else {
      // It's 1, just move current
      current++;
    }
  }
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Single pass through the array
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - In-place sorting with constant extra space

## Dry Run of Optimal Approach

### Example 1: [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Initial: [2,0,2,1,1,0], low=0, high=5, current=0

1. nums[0]=2 → swap with high(5)=0 → [0,0,2,1,1,2], high=4
2. nums[0]=0 → swap with low(0)=0 → [0,0,2,1,1,2], low=1, current=1
3. nums[1]=0 → swap with low(1)=0 → [0,0,2,1,1,2], low=2, current=2
4. nums[2]=2 → swap with high(4)=1 → [0,0,1,1,2,2], high=3
5. nums[2]=1 → current=3
6. nums[3]=1 → current=4
   Done (current > high)

### Example 2: [1,0,2]

Initial: [1,0,2], low=0, high=2, current=0

1. nums[0]=1 → current=1
2. nums[1]=0 → swap with low(0)=1 → [0,1,2], low=1, current=2
3. nums[2]=2 → swap with high(2)=2 → [0,1,2], high=1
   Done (current > high)

### Example 3: [2,2,2] (All same elements)

Initial: [2,2,2], low=0, high=2, current=0

1. nums[0]=2 → swap with high(2)=2 → [2,2,2], high=1
   Done (current > high)

## Edge Cases Covered

1. Mixed elements (Example 1)
2. Already partially sorted (Example 2)
3. All elements same (Example 3)
4. Empty array (would work as loop won't execute)
5. Single element array (would work as loop executes once)

The two-pointer approach is optimal as it solves the problem in a single pass with constant space, making it the best solution for this problem.
