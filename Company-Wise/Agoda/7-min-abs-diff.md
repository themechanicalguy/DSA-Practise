### Problem Understanding

Given an array of distinct integers, we need to:

- Find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements.
- Identify all pairs `[a, b]` where `a < b` and their difference `b - a` equals this minimum difference.
- Return the pairs in ascending order (sorted by the first element of each pair).

For example:
Input: `[4, 2, 1, 3]`
Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
Differences: `2-1=1, 3-2=1, 4-3=1`
Minimum difference: `1`
Output: `[[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]`

### Intuition

1. **Sorting the Array**: Since we need pairs in ascending order and the difference is absolute `(|a - b|)`, sorting the array simplifies finding the minimum difference, as the smallest difference will always be between adjacent elements in a sorted array.
2. **Finding Minimum Difference**: After sorting, compute the differences between consecutive elements and identify the smallest one.
3. **Collecting Pairs with Minimum Difference**: Iterate through the sorted array again to find all pairs where the difference equals the minimum difference.
4. **Edge Cases:**

- Array with fewer than 2 elements (return empty array).
- Array with all elements having the same difference (return all consecutive pairs).
- Array with only one pair having the minimum difference.

### Approaches

1. **Approach 1: Sorting and Two Passes**
   - **Sort the Array**: This allows us to easily find consecutive elements.
   - **First Pass**: Calculate all consecutive differences and find the minimum difference.
   - **Second Pass**: Collect all consecutive pairs that have the minimum difference.

```javascript
function minimumAbsDifference(arr) {
  // Sort the array in ascending order to easily find consecutive elements
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Initialize the minimum difference as Infinity to ensure any difference found will be smaller
  let minDiff = Infinity;
  // Initialize an empty array to store the resulting pairs
  const result = [];

  // First pass: Calculate the differences between consecutive elements to find the minimum difference
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const currentDiff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
    // Update minDiff if the current difference is smaller than the known minimum
    if (currentDiff < minDiff) {
      minDiff = currentDiff;
    }
  }

  // Second pass: Collect all pairs of consecutive elements that have the minimum difference
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const currentDiff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
    // If the current difference matches the minimum difference, add the pair to the result
    if (currentDiff === minDiff) {
      result.push([arr[i - 1], arr[i]]);
    }
  }

  // Return the list of pairs with the minimum absolute difference
  return result;
}
```

2. **Approach 2: Sorting and Single Pass**:
   - **Sort the Array**.
   - **Single Pass**: As we calculate consecutive differences, if we find a new minimum, we reset the result list. If we find the current minimum, we add the pair to the result.

```javascript
function minimumAbsDifference(arr) {
  // Sort the array in ascending order to easily find consecutive elements
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Initialize the minimum difference as Infinity to ensure any difference found will be smaller
  let minDiff = Infinity;
  // Initialize an empty array to store the resulting pairs
  const result = [];

  // Single pass: Calculate differences and collect pairs with the minimum difference
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const currentDiff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];

    // If a new minimum difference is found, update minDiff and reset the result array
    if (currentDiff < minDiff) {
      minDiff = currentDiff;
      result.length = 0; // Clear the result array
      result.push([arr[i - 1], arr[i]]); // Add the current pair
    }
    // If the current difference equals the minimum difference, add the pair to the result
    else if (currentDiff === minDiff) {
      result.push([arr[i - 1], arr[i]]);
    }
  }

  // Return the list of pairs with the minimum absolute difference
  return result;
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Both approaches involve sorting the array, which takes O(n log n) time. The subsequent passes through the array are O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: The space required for the output list is O(k), where k is the number of pairs with the minimum difference. In the worst case, this could be O(n) if all consecutive pairs have the same difference. The sorting algorithm may use O(log n) space for the call stack (for in-place sorting like quicksort). Thus, the space complexity is O(n) for the result and O(log n) for sorting, totaling O(n).

### Dry Run with Examples

#### Example 1: arr = [4, 2, 1, 3]

1. **Sort the array**: [1, 2, 3, 4]
2. **First Pass**:
   - Differences: 2-1=1, 3-2=1, 4-3=1
   - minDiff = 1
3. **Second Pass**:
   - All differences are 1, so collect all consecutive pairs: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]
4. **Output**: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]

#### Example 2: arr = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]

1. **Sort the array**: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
2. **First Pass**:
   - Differences: 3-1=2, 6-3=3, 10-6=4, 15-10=5
   - minDiff = 2
3. **Second Pass**:
   - Only the first difference is 2: [1,3]
4. **Output**: [[1,3]]

#### Example 3: arr = [1, 1, 1, 1] (Edge Case with Duplicates)

- But the problem states that the array has distinct integers, so this case is invalid. However, if we consider arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:

1. **Sort the array**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
2. **First Pass**:
   - Differences: 1, 1, 1, 1
   - minDiff = 1
3. **Second Pass**:
   - All differences are 1: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5]
4. **Output**: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5]]

### Conclusion

The optimal approach involves sorting the array first, which simplifies finding the minimum absolute difference and collecting the relevant pairs. Both approaches provided are efficient with O(n log n) time complexity, but the single-pass approach can be slightly more efficient in practice as it combines the difference calculation and pair collection into one loop.
