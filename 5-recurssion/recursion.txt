Used in :
    1. JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
    2. document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
    3. Object traversal
    4. Very common with more complex algorithms
    5. It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration


  Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!

Base Case: The condition when the recursion ends.

Two essential parts of a recursive function!
1. Base Case
2. Different Input


Simple Summary: 
    A recursive function is a function that invokes itself
    Your recursive functions should always have a base case and be invoked with different input each time
    When using recursion, it's often essential to return values from one function to another to extract data from each function call
    Helper method recursion is an alternative that allows us to use an external scope in our recursive functions
    Pure recursion eliminates the need for helper method recursion, but can be trickier to understand at first
