### Problem Understanding

The problem requires us to group anagrams together from a given list of strings. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" are anagrams of each other.

### Intuition

To group anagrams, we need a way to identify which strings are anagrams of each other. One effective way is to use a common key for all anagrams. Two strings are anagrams if their sorted versions are the same. For example, sorting "eat", "tea", and "ate" all result in "aet". Therefore, we can use the sorted version of a string as a key in a hash map, where the value is a list of all strings that, when sorted, equal the key.

### Approaches

1. **Sorting and Hash Map**:

   - For each string in the input array, sort the string to form a key.
   - Use a hash map to group all strings that share the same sorted key.
   - The values of the hash map will be the grouped anagrams.

```javascript
/**
 * Groups anagrams together from the given array of strings.
 * @param {string[]} strs - The array of strings to group.
 * @return {string[][]} - The grouped anagrams.
 */
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const anagramGroups = new Map();

  for (const str of strs) {
    // Sort the string to form the key
    const sortedStr = str.split("").sort().join("");

    // If the key exists, add the string to the group; otherwise, create a new group
    if (anagramGroups.has(sortedStr)) {
      anagramGroups.get(sortedStr).push(str);
    } else {
      anagramGroups.set(sortedStr, [str]);
    }
  }

  // Convert the map values to an array and return
  return Array.from(anagramGroups.values());
  //   let res = [];
  //   for (let [key, value] of fMap) {
  //     res.push(value);
  //   }
  //   return res;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"])); // [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
console.log(groupAnagrams([""])); // [[""]]
console.log(groupAnagrams(["a"])); // [["a"]]
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(nk log k)`, where n is the number of strings and k is the maximum length of a string. This is because sorting each string takes O(k log k) time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n k)`, as we store all strings in the hash map.

#### Approach 2: Character Count and Hash Map

- Instead of sorting, we can count the frequency of each character in the string and use that as a key.
- For example, "eat" can be represented as "a1e1t1".
- This avoids the O(k log k) sorting time for each string (where k is the length of the string), but constructing the key is O(k).

```javascript
/**
 * Groups anagrams together using character counts as keys.
 * @param {string[]} strs - The array of strings to group.
 * @return {string[][]} - The grouped anagrams.
 */
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
  const anagramGroups = new Map();

  for (const str of strs) {
    const count = new Array(26).fill(0); // Assuming only lowercase letters
    for (const char of str) {
      count[char.charCodeAt(0) - "a".charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }
    // Convert the count array to a string to use as a key
    const key = count.join("#");

    if (anagramGroups.has(key)) {
      anagramGroups.get(key).push(str);
    } else {
      anagramGroups.set(key, [str]);
    }
  }

  return Array.from(anagramGroups.values());
}

// Example Usage
console.log(groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"])); // [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
console.log(groupAnagrams([""])); // [[""]]
console.log(groupAnagrams(["a"])); // [["a"]]
```

- **Time Complexity**: `O(nk)`, where n is the number of strings and k is the maximum length of a string. Counting characters is O(k) per string.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(nk)`, similar to the first approach, but the keys are based on character counts which can be more space-efficient for longer strings.

### Dry Run

#### Example 1: ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

- **Approach 1**:

  - "eat" → sorted "aet" → key "aet" → map: {"aet": ["eat"]}
  - "tea" → sorted "aet" → key "aet" → map: {"aet": ["eat", "tea"]}
  - "tan" → sorted "ant" → key "ant" → map: {"aet": ["eat", "tea"], "ant": ["tan"]}
  - "ate" → sorted "aet" → key "aet" → map: {"aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ant": ["tan"]}
  - "nat" → sorted "ant" → key "ant" → map: {"aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ant": ["tan", "nat"]}
  - "bat" → sorted "abt" → key "abt" → map: {"aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"], "ant": ["tan", "nat"], "abt": ["bat"]}
  - Result: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]

- **Approach 2**:
  - "eat" → count [a:1, e:1, t:1] → key "1#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#0#1#0#0#0#0#0#0" → map: {key: ["eat"]}
  - Similarly for others, grouping by the same key.
  - Result is the same as above.

#### Example 2: [""]

- Both approaches:
  - "" → sorted "" or count all zeros → key "" or "0#0#..." → map: {"": [""]}
  - Result: [[""]]

#### Example 3: ["a"]

- Both approaches:
  - "a" → sorted "a" or count [a:1, others 0] → key "a" or "1#0#..." → map: {key: ["a"]}
  - Result: [["a"]]

### Edge Cases Covered

1. **Empty String**: Handled by considering it as a valid string with no characters.
2. **Single Character**: Handled by treating it as its own group.
3. **Multiple Anagrams**: Correctly groups all anagrams together regardless of their order in the input.

### Optimal Approach

The second approach (Character Count) is generally more optimal for longer strings because it avoids the O(k log k) sorting step, reducing the time complexity to O(n \* k). However, for very short strings, the overhead of constructing the count key might make the sorting approach faster in practice. Both approaches are valid and handle all edge cases effectively.
