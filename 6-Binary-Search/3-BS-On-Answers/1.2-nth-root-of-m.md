# Problem Statement

Given two numbers N and M, find the Nth root of M. The Nth root of a number M is defined as a number X such that when X is raised to the power of N, it equals M. If the Nth root is not an integer, return -1.
Examples:
Input: N = 3, M = 27
Output: 3
Explanation: The cube root of 27 is equal to 3.
Input: N = 4, M = 69
Output:-1
Explanation: The 4th root of 69 does not exist. So, the answer is -1.

### **Intuition and Approach**

To find the Nth root of a number M, we need to find a number X such that X^N = M. If no such integer X exists, we should return -1.

**Binary Search Approach:**

1. **Range Identification**: The Nth root of M (if it exists) will lie between 1 and M. For example:
   - For N=3 and M=27, the cube root is 3.
   - For N=4 and M=69, no integer X satisfies X^4 = 69.
2. **Binary Search**: We can use binary search to efficiently check possible values of X in the range [1, M].
3. **Mid Calculation**: For each mid value in the binary search, compute mid^N:
   - If mid^N equals M, return mid.
   - If mid^N < M, search the right half.
   - If mid^N > M, search the left half.
4. **Early Termination**: If we exhaust the search space without finding X, return -1.

### **Solution Code (JavaScript)**

```javascript
/**
 * Function to find the Nth root of M using binary search.
 * @param {number} N - The root to find (e.g., 3 for cube root).
 * @param {number} M - The number to find the root of (e.g., 27).
 * @return {number} - The Nth root if it exists, otherwise -1.
 */
function nthRoot(N, M) {
  if (M === 1) return 1; // The Nth root of 1 is always 1 for any N.
  if (N === 1) return M; // The 1st root of M is M itself.

  let low = 1;
  let high = M;
  let result = -1;

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    //The time complexity of Math.pow() in JavaScript is generally considered to be O(1), or constant time.
    let power = Math.pow(mid, N);
    if (power === M) {
      return mid; // Found the exact Nth root.
    } else if (power < M) {
      low = mid + 1; // Search in the right half.
    } else {
      high = mid - 1; // Search in the left half.
    }
  }

  return result; // Return -1 if not found.
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(nthRoot(3, 27)); // Output: 3 (3^3 = 27)
console.log(nthRoot(4, 69)); // Output: -1 (No integer X satisfies X^4 = 69)
console.log(nthRoot(2, 16)); // Output: 4 (4^2 = 16)
console.log(nthRoot(5, 3125)); // Output: 5 (5^5 = 3125)
console.log(nthRoot(3, 30)); // Output: -1 (No integer X satisfies X^3 = 30)
```

### **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(log M)
  - Binary search reduces the search space by half in each iteration, leading to logarithmic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of input size.

### **Dry Run with Examples**

**Example 1: N = 3, M = 27**

- low = 1, high = 27
- Iteration 1: mid = 14, 14^3 = 2744 > 27 → high = 13
- Iteration 2: mid = 7, 7^3 = 343 > 27 → high = 6
- Iteration 3: mid = 3, 3^3 = 27 == 27 → return 3

**Example 2: N = 4, M = 69**

- low = 1, high = 69
- Iteration 1: mid = 35, 35^4 is very large → high = 34
- Iteration 2: mid = 17, 17^4 = 83521 > 69 → high = 16
- Iteration 3: mid = 8, 8^4 = 4096 > 69 → high = 7
- Iteration 4: mid = 4, 4^4 = 256 > 69 → high = 3
- Iteration 5: mid = 2, 2^4 = 16 < 69 → low = 3
- Iteration 6: mid = 3, 3^4 = 81 > 69 → high = 2
- Now low > high → exit loop → return -1

**Example 3: N = 2, M = 16**

- low = 1, high = 16
- Iteration 1: mid = 8, 8^2 = 64 > 16 → high = 7
- Iteration 2: mid = 4, 4^2 = 16 == 16 → return 4

This approach efficiently narrows down the search space to find the Nth root or determine its absence.
