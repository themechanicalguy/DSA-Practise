# Pattern: Binary Search on Implicitly Sorted Spaces

Binary search can be applied to problems where the search space isnâ€™t an explicit sorted array but behaves like one (e.g., indices, time, or other ordered quantities).

## Key Insight

- Define a **search space** (e.g., range of indices or values).
- Establish a **condition** that allows you to eliminate half of the search space in each step.

## Time Complexity

- **O(log n) \* O(f)**, where `f` is the cost of evaluating the condition.

## Examples

1. **Find the kth smallest element in a sorted matrix**

   - Problem: [LeetCode: Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

2. **Guess a number in a number guessing game**
   - Problem: [LeetCode: Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

## Conditions

1. The search space must have an **order** (explicit or implicit).
2. A **condition** must exist to decide which half of the search space to discard.
