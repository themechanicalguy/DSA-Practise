# LC 410. Split Array Largest Sum || Minimize Largest Sum of K Subarrays

## Problem statement:

Given an array `nums` which consists of non-negative integers and an integer `m`, you can split the array into `m` non-empty continuous subarrays.
Write an algorithm to minimize the largest `sum` among these `m` subarrays.
Return the `minimized largest sum of the split`.

- A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

**Example 1:**

- Input: nums = `[7,2,5,10,8]`, m = `2`
- Output: 18
- Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
  The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.

**Example 2:**

- Input: nums = `[1,2,3,4,5]`, m = `2`
- Output: 9
- Explanation: There are two ways to split nums into two subarrays.
  The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.

## Problem Understanding

We need to split an array into `k` contiguous subarrays such that the largest sum among these subarrays is as small as possible.

## Intuition

The goal is to divide the array `nums` into `k` contiguous subarrays such that the maximum sum of any subarray is as small as possible.
This is an optimization problem where we need to find the smallest possible maximum subarray sum.

### Key Observations:

- **Lower Bound:** If `k = 1`, the entire array is one subarray, so the minimum largest sum is the sum of all elements in nums. If `k = n` (where `n` is the array length), each element is its own subarray, so the minimum largest sum is the maximum element in `nums`.
- **Upper Bound:** The largest possible maximum subarray sum is the sum of all elements in `nums` (when `k = 1`).
- **Feasibility Check:** For a given target sum `target`, we can check if it’s possible to split the array into `k` or fewer subarrays where each subarray’s sum is at most `target`. If it’s possible, we can try a smaller `target`; if not, we need a larger `target`.
- **Binary Search Applicability:** Since we’re looking for the smallest target that allows splitting into `k` subarrays, and the feasibility check is monotonic (if a target is feasible, all larger sums are feasible), binary search can be used to find the minimal target.

## Approaches to Solve the Problem

We’ll implement three approaches in JavaScript:

- **Binary Search Approach (Optimal):** Use binary search to find the minimal largest sum.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Use DP to compute the minimum largest sum for all possible splits.
- **Greedy Approach with Backtracking:** Try all possible splits recursively (less efficient but illustrative).

## Binary Search with Greedy Validation (Optimal Approach)

**Intuition**:

- Use binary search to guess the minimum maximum sum
- For each guess, check if it's possible to split the array into <= k parts where no part exceeds the guess

**Complexity**:

- Time: O(n × log(sum(nums))) - Binary search with linear validation
- Space: O(1) - Constant extra space

```javascript
function splitArray(nums, k) {
  // The minimal possible answer is the maximum single element
  // (when we split into n subarrays, each containing one element)
  let left = Math.max(...nums);

  // The maximal possible answer is the sum of all elements
  // (when we have just one subarray containing everything)
  let right = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);

  // Binary search between left and right to find the minimal maximum sum
  while (left < right) {
    // Try mid as our candidate for the minimal maximum sum
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    // Check if it's possible to split into <= k subarrays
    // where each subarray sum is <= mid
    if (canSplit(nums, mid, k)) {
      // If possible, try to find a smaller sum
      right = mid;
    } else {
      // If not possible, we need to try larger sums
      left = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  // When left == right, we've found our minimal maximum sum
  return left;
}

// Helper function to check if we can split nums into <= k subarrays
// where each subarray sum is <= maxSum
function canSplit(nums, maxSum, k) {
  let currentSum = 0; // Tracks sum of current subarray
  let splitsRequired = 1; // We start with 1 subarray (the whole array)

  for (const num of nums) {
    currentSum += num;

    // If adding this number exceeds maxSum, we need a new split
    if (currentSum > maxSum) {
      splitsRequired++; // Increment split count
      currentSum = num; // Start new subarray with current number

      // If we've exceeded k splits, return false
      if (splitsRequired > k) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  // If we completed the array with <= k splits, return true
  return true;
}
```

## Dry Run of Optimal Approach (Binary Search)

### Example 1: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2

- left = max(7,2,5,10,8) = 10
- right = 7+2+5+10+8 = 32

**Iteration 1**: mid = (10+32)/2 = 21

- canSplit(21):
  - [7,2,5] = 14 ≤ 21
  - [10,8] = 18 ≤ 21
  - splits = 2 ≤ k → possible
- right = 21

**Iteration 2**: mid = (10+21)/2 = 15

- canSplit(15):
  - [7,2,5] = 14 ≤ 15
  - [10] = 10 ≤ 15
  - [8] = 8 ≤ 15
  - splits = 3 > k → not possible
- left = 16

**Iteration 3**: mid = (16+21)/2 = 18

- canSplit(18):
  - [7,2,5] = 14 ≤ 18
  - [10,8] = 18 ≤ 18
  - splits = 2 ≤ k → possible
- right = 18

**Iteration 4**: left=16, right=18, mid=17

- canSplit(17):
  - [7,2,5] = 14 ≤ 17
  - [10] = 10 ≤ 17
  - [8] = 8 ≤ 17
  - splits = 3 > k → not possible
- left = 18

Now left == right → return 18

### Example 2: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

- left = 5, right = 15

**Iteration 1**: mid = 10

- canSplit(10):
  - [1,2,3,4] = 10 ≤ 10
  - [5] = 5 ≤ 10
  - splits = 2 ≤ k → possible
- right = 10

**Iteration 2**: mid = 7

- canSplit(7):
  - [1,2,3] = 6 ≤ 7
  - [4] = 4 ≤ 7
  - [5] = 5 ≤ 7
  - splits = 3 > k → not possible
- left = 8

**Iteration 3**: mid = 9

- canSplit(9):
  - [1,2,3] = 6 ≤ 9
  - [4,5] = 9 ≤ 9
  - splits = 2 ≤ k → possible
- right = 9

**Iteration 4**: mid = 8

- canSplit(8):
  - [1,2,3] = 6 ≤ 8
  - [4] = 4 ≤ 8
  - [5] = 5 ≤ 8
  - splits = 3 > k → not possible
- left = 9

Now left == right → return 9

### Edge Case Example: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 5

- left = 1, right = 5
- First iteration mid = 3 → canSplit returns true (each element separate)
- right = 3
- Next mid = 2 → canSplit returns true
- right = 2
- Next mid = 1 → canSplit returns true
- right = 1
- Now left == right → return 1 (each element is its own subarray)

## Conclusion

The binary search approach is more efficient with O(n log sum(nums)) time complexity compared to the DP approach's O(n²k) complexity. It's particularly suitable for large arrays where the sum of elements is manageable (not extremely large).
